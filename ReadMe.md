## Technical Details
This project took a lot of time and effort:
- Every shape on the screen is created from scratch using code and mathematical calculation
- I designed everything myself then implemented it using OpenGL and C++
- Every action is connected to audio feedback using sound effects and visual feedback
- All sound is added using OpenAL
